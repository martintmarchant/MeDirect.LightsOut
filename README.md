# MeDirect.LightsOut
LightsOut


here is the backend solution for the LightsOut game.
The solution runs in a docker container and is located in 

MeDirect.LightsOut.Api

the database has been pushed to AWS, and has also been scripted into a 
database project.
On AWS I created a new free db instance (for this project), and have left the connection details in
for your convenience.

Regards


Martin
